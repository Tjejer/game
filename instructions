The game is built on cooperation between shell and game. The shell deals with the user inputs.
How we chose to implement intelligence:
We chose to not have a a separate intelligence class. Instead we thought it would be much cleaner and better to implement it as a method inside the game.py file.


unzip the game.zip map and navigate to the folder through the terminal/git bash.
 write 'make install' to install the needed packages
'write 'python3 main.py' in your console to run the code.
'make test'
'make coverage'

For software documentation:
istall graphviz:
Linux: apt install graphviz
Mac OS: brew install graphviz
Windows: choco install graphviz

Now you can write 'make doc' to generate the documentation for the program. You can write make clean to remove all the docs.
