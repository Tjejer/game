The game is built on cooperation between shell and game. The shell deals with the user inputs.
How we chose to implement intelligence:
We chose to not have a a separate intelligence class. Instead we thought it would be much cleaner and better to implement it as a method inside the game.py file.


To install the game on your computer:
unzip the game.zip map and navigate to the folder through the terminal/git bash.
 write 'make install' to install the needed packages
'write 'python3 main.py' or 'python main.py' in your console to run the code. Exit the game. Now you can do the following:

write 'make test' to test for flake8 and pylint
There are some errors that we chose to ignore with pylint(for example -> no-self-use) because we needed these methods for the program to function.
write 'make coverage' to test for code test coverage

For software documentation:
istall graphviz:
Linux: apt install graphviz
Mac OS: brew install graphviz
Windows: choco install graphviz

Now you can write 'make doc' to generate the documentation for the program. You can write make clean to remove all the docs.
